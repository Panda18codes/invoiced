## My process

### Built with

- React
- CSS Modules + PostCSS (custom media queries)
- [React Hook Forms](https://www.react-hook-form.com)
- [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs) lightweight state management üêª
- [Nivo](https://nivo.rocks) for pie and line chart
- [Radix UI Primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com) for headless accessible components (Select, Dialog, Popover, Checkbox)

### What I learned

rhf, nivo, zustand and radix-ui were new to me and I had so much fun playing around with them :3 Used CSS variables for light/dark mode and can't help but wonder how messy it would be maintaining so many variables for each mode in a big project.

### Continued development

There are so many things to make this project even better:

- Import/Export Invoices to/from a file.
- A full blown dashboard with weekly/monthly/yearly dataviz. (I just did yearly overview for now) + option to download the report
- Make nivo charts accessible? Expore how to even do that T^T
- Making this a fullstack app ‚ú®
